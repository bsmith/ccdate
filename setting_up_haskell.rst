Setting Up An Haskell Environment
========================================================================

The current haskell.org "Get Started" guide suggests using ghcup.
The five components you need are: ghcup, ghc, haskell-language-server, haskell-stack, cabal-install.

After installing ghcup make sure to add the PATH modifications to your shell's RC file.

The project was then created with ``cabal init``.
